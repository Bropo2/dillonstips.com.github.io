<p>The concept of &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;left&#8221; in the Old Testament is laden with symbolic and spiritual meaning. Ancient Hebrew texts often associate the right with honor, righteousness, and divine favor, while the left is seen as a place of rejection, shame, and punishment. Additionally, there is a theme of those who walk in the &#8220;middle&#8221; or remain steadfast in their faith and obedience to God being seen as honorable. This post will explore these themes using several Old Testament scriptures to demonstrate how they were applied to individuals, nations, and even spiritual concepts, showing a preference for the right, condemnation for the left, and honor for those who remained centered in their devotion to God.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Symbolism of the Right Hand in the Old Testament</h3>



<p>Throughout the Old Testament, the &#8220;right hand&#8221; is associated with power, honor, and blessing. It often represents the side of righteousness and God&#8217;s divine favor. For instance, in Psalm 110:1, we read:</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The Lord says to my lord: &#8216;Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.&#8217;”</strong></p>



<p>Here, the &#8220;right hand&#8221; symbolizes a place of honor and authority. This idea of being seated at God’s right hand is also echoed in the New Testament, particularly in reference to Christ’s exaltation. It shows how deeply ingrained this symbolism was in ancient Hebrew thought, with the right hand being connected to God&#8217;s blessing and favor.</p>



<p>Moreover, in Exodus 15:6, when Moses sings about God’s deliverance of Israel from the Egyptians, he says:</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Your right hand, Lord, was majestic in power. Your right hand, Lord, shattered the enemy.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Here, the right hand is associated with God’s might and ability to deliver His people from their enemies. It is an expression of divine strength and protection.</p>



<p>The right hand’s favor also extends to individuals. In Genesis 48:14, Jacob blesses his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh. Although Manasseh is the elder, Jacob crosses his hands, placing his right hand on Ephraim, the younger son, signifying greater blessing. This act causes confusion, but Jacob insists:</p>



<p><strong>“I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.”</strong> (Genesis 48:19)</p>



<p>Jacob’s deliberate placement of the right hand on Ephraim reflects the significance of divine favor and the prominence given to the right side.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Left Hand: Symbol of Disgrace and Rejection</h3>



<p>In contrast, the left hand is often associated with rejection or even disgrace. While the Bible does not dwell on the left hand as much as the right, it appears in verses that highlight the favoring of the right and imply a lesser status for the left. For example, Ecclesiastes 10:2 says:</p>



<p><strong>“The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.”</strong></p>



<p>This verse reinforces the symbolic dichotomy between wisdom and folly, positioning the right as wise and righteous and the left as foolish and wayward. It is important to note that this is not merely about physical orientation but about the moral and spiritual direction that a person chooses. The right side, in this sense, represents alignment with God&#8217;s will and His ways, while the left represents a departure from that path.</p>



<p>In another passage, Jesus Himself alludes to the symbolic use of the left and right in the parable of the sheep and goats, although the parable is found in the New Testament, it reflects a continuation of Old Testament imagery. In Matthew 25:33-34, Jesus says:</p>



<p><strong>“He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.’”</strong></p>



<p>Those on the right inherit the kingdom, while those on the left are cast into eternal punishment. This judgment scene echoes the Old Testament themes of the right being a place of honor and the left a place of rejection, underscoring the symbolic meaning that originated in the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walking the Middle Path: Balance and Honor</h3>



<p>While the right hand holds special significance, there is also an emphasis in the Old Testament on walking the &#8220;middle path&#8221;—the path of righteousness, justice, and obedience to God. This middle path is often seen as honorable, representing steadfastness and a commitment to living according to God’s laws.</p>



<p>Proverbs 4:26-27 advises:</p>



<p><strong>“Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.”</strong></p>



<p>This counsel emphasizes the importance of staying true to the path of righteousness and avoiding extremes. Turning &#8220;to the right or the left&#8221; here implies a deviation from the correct course—one that could lead to sin or moral failure. The &#8220;middle&#8221; in this context represents a life of faithfulness to God’s commands.</p>



<p>Similarly, in Deuteronomy 5:32-33, Moses instructs the Israelites:</p>



<p><strong>“So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left. Walk in obedience to all that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.”</strong></p>



<p>Once again, the idea of walking in the middle, or in a straight path of obedience, is associated with blessing, prosperity, and life. Deviating from this path—whether to the right or left—leads to danger, dishonor, and potentially destruction.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Pit and the Left: The Consequences of Disobedience</h3>



<p>In contrast to those who walk faithfully in the middle, those who stray to the left are often cast into the pit—a place of shame, punishment, and even death. The &#8220;pit&#8221; in the Old Testament frequently symbolizes Sheol, the realm of the dead, or a place of divine judgment. The imagery of being cast down into a pit reflects the consequences of sin and rebellion against God.</p>



<p>In Psalm 28:1, David pleads:</p>



<p><strong>“To You, Lord, I call; You are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if You remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit.”</strong></p>



<p>Here, the pit represents separation from God and the terror of being left in a state of divine rejection. The pit is often associated with those who have turned away from God&#8217;s righteousness. Proverbs 28:10 also warns of the consequences of leading others astray:</p>



<p><strong>“Whoever leads the upright along an evil path will fall into their own trap, but the blameless will receive a good inheritance.”</strong></p>



<p>Those who lead others to the left—to a path of wickedness—will eventually fall into destruction themselves, symbolized by the pit. Meanwhile, those who remain blameless and walk the righteous middle path will inherit blessing and honor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: The Favor of the Right, the Shame of the Left, and the Honor of the Middle</h3>



<p>The Old Testament&#8217;s symbolic use of &#8220;<a href="https://www.1517.org/articles/gods-right-hand#:~:text=God%20says%20through%20the%20prophet,the%20left%2C%20he%20comforts%20them." target="_blank" rel="noopener">right</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.iswasandwillbe.com/gods-left-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a>&#8221; reflects deep spiritual truths about honor, righteousness, and divine favor. The right hand represents the side of power, blessing, and salvation, while the left is often linked to disgrace, rejection, and destruction. Yet, perhaps most importantly, the concept of walking the &#8220;middle path&#8221; —remaining steadfast in faith, obedient to God&#8217;s commands, and not veering to the right or left—emerges as a key theme of honor in the Old Testament. Those who walk in the middle are blessed, while those who stray face divine judgment and disgrace.</p>



<p>These symbols continue to shape religious understanding, offering believers a profound reflection on the choices they make in their spiritual journeys. Staying in the middle, on the path of righteousness, honors God and ensures the blessings of life and prosperity, while favoring the right reflects God&#8217;s favor and eternal life. The left, however, represents a life veering from truth, often leading to the pit of shame and punishment.</p>
